## Branding and Naming Requirements ##

The name of the frame is called Mode 2 Trimaxion, or "Max" for short. If you intend to manufacture this frame, it must be named "**Mode 2 - Max *by Name***", so in order to distinguish yourself from us as the manufacturer.  Max must always carry its text badge somewhere on the main plate, using the free font outlined below.
