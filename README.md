## Branding and Naming Requirements ##

The name of the frame is called Mode 2 Trimaxion, or "Max" for short. If you intend to manufacture this frame, it must be prefaced with your own name in order to distinguish it from the Mode 2 line of products.  Max must always carry the text badge somewhere on the main plates, using the free font outlined below.
